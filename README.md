# Vigilion Scanner API

This app is the responsible for processing files and scanning them to see if they are clean or if they contain viruses.

It also contains the models for company accounts and plans, and scanning API keys, however now this is open source, you can create a plan with no limit and assign that to each accounts API key.

## Scanning Flow

1) User uploads the file to the **client app**

2) The **client app** saves the file on a public accessible
storage (S3 or similar) and calls **Vigilion Scanner** with a
URL to download the file.

3) Vigilion Scanner check the **client app** credentials and if
everything is ok, it schedules the scan using **Sidekiq**.

4) An async process downloads the file and performs the scan.

5) Once the file was scanned, **Virus Scanner** sends a
callback request to the **client app**

6) The client checks credentials and then updates the file
status accordingly.

There is an alternative flow which instead of sending the URL,
the client app sends the raw file.
In this scenario, **Vigilion Scanner** stores temporarily the
file until the async process analyzes it.

## API methods

### `POST   /scans`
Creates a new scan request and queues it.
Params:
* `scan[key]`: This is a key to map your model to ours.
The scanner wont do anything with it but it requires to be there.

* `scan[url]`: URL to download the actual file

Or alternatively:
* `scan[file]`: Instead of sending a URL it sends the actual file.

### `GET    /scans/:id`

## Application setup

### Hardware requirements

API server should have at least 4GB of RAM memory and 2GB for storage

### Local Install

Install docker and run:

    docker-compose up

This will build and start the containers. Now need to create the database:

    docker-compose run web rake db:create

Optionally seed database:

    docker-compose run web rake db:seed

#### Setup accounts

List plans:

    docker-compose run web rake plans:list

Create an account using `accounts:create` task. Arguments in required order: plan_id, project_name, callback_url
Example:

    docker-compose run web rake "accounts:create[1,demo,https://localhost/vigilion/callback]"

* Rake task will output details of the account just created, including X-Api-Key required for API requests

#### Setup env vars on Target Rails app side

In .env you need to specify following env variables
```
DISABLE_VIRUS_SCANNER=false # it true by default on localhost
VIRUS_SCANNER_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 # can be different on your side
VIRUS_SCANNER_API_KEY=<API KEY>
```

## Testing

To run specs execute

    docker-compose run web bash

and within container:

    bundle exec rspec

You can also test the API using postman.
